Revision history for Perl extension Image::BioChrome

1.16

* Changed the internal structure to allow easier implementation of color 
  calculations that affect every color in the palette

* Added a percent method which allows percentage adjustment of every color in
  the color palette


1.15

* Updated the examples and files in the documentation directory

* Removed requirement for File::MMagic as this is seriously broken with versions
  prior to 1.71 and although I have submitted a patch at the moment I don't
  really need to use it to check that the file is a gif file.

1.14

* Documentation updates

* Patch from Andy Wardley applied to add documentation for the Template Plugin.

1.13

* Fixed an issue with temporary files getting left behind when we fail to write 
  the file for any reason

1.12

* Added additional validation on color information passed to BioChrome.pm
  Invalid colors are now ignored by BioChrome, I thought long and hard about 
  how to handle these but decided in the end it was easier to ignore them as 
  this would make the code in Apache::BioChrome simpler

* Added additional tests to check the color validation added above

1.11

* Changed the default behaviour so that files get automatically reset after 
  writing.  This used to be the case that calling write_file twice would color
  the image twice.  This caused strange and non-valuable behaviour on alpha
  colors and so has been changed.  This also means that the reset_file method
  can now go.
* Beefed up the 01biochrome tests to ensure that the files produced are the 
  correct colors
* Added the internal _safedump method for use when testing

1.10
* Added biochrome_path to Apache::BioChrome to allow for layering of images
* Fixed BioChrome to set the same owner and permissions as the source file on
  any file which it creates by default
* Split the DummyRequest module out of 03apache.t so that it can be reused in 
  more than one test
* Fixed a bug in Apache::BioChrome when the url has no colors in it.  It will
  now correctly copy the file

1.09
Released to a small sample of users to check that the interfaces work

1.08
Made die the default when failing to make it easier to return errors to 
the Template::Toolkit

1.06

Modification of the colors and alphas handling to allow color strings in more
flexible ways.  Tidied up some of the tests for the base module.

1.03

Changed the default behavior for unknown file types.  We now treat unknown
files as a copy operation rather than failing to create the object.  This 
simplifies the handling of errors in calling code.

1.02

The first real release of the module
