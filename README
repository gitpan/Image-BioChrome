NAME
    Image::BioChrome - Colorise gif files by rewriting the color table

    This module is still considered ALPHA code, the module and interfaces
    are still subject to change.

SYNOPSIS
            my $bio = new Image::BioChrome $file;

            $bio->colors(.....);

            or 

            $bio->alphas(.....);

            $bio->write_file($file);

            # cause the file to be re-read from the source
            $bio->read_file();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to recolor images files. I built it because I am
    regularly producing web sites with many common interface graphics where
    we just need to change the colors. The name BioChrome comes from the
    name of the special color changing cells that give a Chameleon its color
    changing ability.

    Also included in the distribution are modules that allow Apache (with
    mod_perl) to build images on the fly and a Template::Toolkit plugin to
    allow the creation of images from within a Template.

    An instance of a Image::BioChrome should be created for each image file
    that you want to work on.

    my $b = new Image::BioChrome 'test.gif';

    In order to then change the colors you need to pass the color change
    information to the module using either the colors or alphas methods.
    Both methods support passing the color information as either a "color
    string" or an array ref to a set of colors.

    A color string is simply a series of hexadecimal rgb triples separated
    by character other than 0-9, a-f or #. For example ff0000_00ff00_0000ff
    is red followed by green followed by blue.

    $b->colors('ff0000_00ff00_0000ff')

    or

    $b->colors(['ff0000','00ff00','0000ff']);

    or

    $b->colors('ff0000','00ff00','0000ff');

    The same rules apply for the setting of alpha colors.

    Now you may be asking yourself what the module does with the color
    information. The best answer is to look at the documentation in the
    examples directory. Explaining how colors are processed in ascii art is
    really difficult.

    Once you have passed the relevant color information the file can be
    written to disk by calling the write file method.

    $b->write_file('output.gif');

    Currently BioChrome will only recolor GIF files. Any file which it is
    not capable of being recolored will simply be copied when write_file is
    called.
