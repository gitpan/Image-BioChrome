NAME
    Image::BioChrome - Colorise gif files by rewriting the color table

    This module is still considered ALPHA code, the module and interfaces
    are still subject to change.

SYNOPSIS
            my $bio = new Image::BioChrome $file;

            $bio->colors(.....);

            or 

            $bio->alphas(.....);

            or

            $bio->percents(100, 100, 50)

            $bio->write_file($file);

            # cause the file to be re-read from the source
            $bio->read_file();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to recolor images files. I built it because I am
    regularly producing web sites with many common interface graphics where
    we just need to change the colors. The name BioChrome comes from the
    name of the special color changing cells that give a Chameleon its color
    changing ability.

    Also included in the distribution are modules that allow Apache (with
    mod_perl) to build images on the fly and a Template::Toolkit plugin to
    allow the creation of images from within a Template.

    An instance of a Image::BioChrome should be created for each image file
    that you want to work on.

    my $b = new Image::BioChrome 'test.gif';

    In order to then change the colors you need to call one of the color
    change methods detailed below. There the method requires a color string
    it will accept the input as either a string of color values or as an
    array ref to a set of colors.

    A color string is simply a series of hexadecimal rgb triples separated
    by character other than 0-9, a-f or #. For example ff0000_00ff00_0000ff
    is red followed by green followed by blue.

    $b->colors('ff0000_00ff00_0000ff')

    or

    $b->colors(['ff0000','00ff00','0000ff']);

    or

    $b->colors('ff0000','00ff00','0000ff');

    Now you may be asking yourself what the module does with the color
    information. The best answer is to look at the documentation in the
    examples directory. Explaining how colors are processed in ascii art is
    really difficult.

    Once you have passed the relevant color information the file can be
    written to disk by calling the write file method.

    $b->write_file('output.gif');

    Currently BioChrome will only recolor GIF files. Any file which it is
    not capable of being recolored will simply be copied when write_file is
    called.

Color Change Methods
  alphas
    Expects a color string with upto four colors. Every color in the color
    palette will be changed. The four colors are blended according to the
    amount of red, green and blue in the image.

  colors
    Expects a set of colors upto the number of colors in the color palette.
    The colors will be replaced with the colors given.

  percents ( red_percent, green_percent, blue_percent )
    Changes every color in the palette by adjusting the amount each part of
    the color by the percentages given.
